# HLS Downloader

A tiny single-file GUI downloader for HLS (.m3u8) streams that wraps ffmpeg.

This project provides a minimal Tkinter-based GUI (`hls_gui.py`) which uses
`ffmpeg`/`ffprobe` to download and package HLS streams to MP4 or MKV without
re-encoding. The script is intentionally self-contained and includes light
checks to help macOS users install missing dependencies via Homebrew.

## Features

- Paste an `.m3u8` URL.
- Choose destination and filename (Save As...).
- Progress bar and log output (uses `ffmpeg -progress`).
- Attempts to help install `ffmpeg` / `ffprobe` and `python-tk` on macOS.

## Requirements

- macOS (tested conceptually; works on other platforms with Python/Tkinter and ffmpeg)
- Python 3.10+ (3.13 recommended via Homebrew on recent macOS)
- ffmpeg and ffprobe available on PATH
- Tkinter available for the Python installation (GUI)

On macOS it's easiest to use Homebrew to install missing components.

## Quick start (macOS)

1. Install Homebrew (if you don't have it):

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

2. Install Python and ffmpeg (if needed):

```bash
# Install Python 3
brew install python

# Install ffmpeg
brew install ffmpeg

# If tkinter is missing for the Homebrew Python build, install the matching package
# (the script will suggest the correct package name, e.g. python-tk@3.13):
brew install python-tk@3.13
```

3. Run the GUI:

```bash
python3 "hls_gui.py"
```

The script will also detect missing `ffmpeg`/`ffprobe` or `python-tk` and offer
to install them via Homebrew when run interactively.

## Usage

1. Paste an `.m3u8` URL into the URL field.
2. Click "Chooseâ€¦" to pick output folder and filename (or leave default).
3. Click "Download". Progress and logs will appear in the window.

The output file will be written without re-encoding (stream copy). For MP4 the
script applies the `aac_adtstoasc` bitstream filter and `+faststart` movflag to
make the file streamable.

## Troubleshooting

- "Tkinter not available": If you see this, install Python from python.org or
  use Homebrew's `python` and install `python-tk@<version>` (the GUI will
  suggest the matching package).
- "ffmpeg not found": Install via Homebrew: `brew install ffmpeg`.
- Permission errors writing to the destination: pick a folder under your
  home directory, or run the script with appropriate permissions.

## Development notes

- The main script is `hls_gui.py` and is intentionally a single-file app so you
  can copy it to another machine easily.
- There's also a small CLI helper `m3u8_dl.py` included for command-line use.
